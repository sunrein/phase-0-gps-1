###What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I did not know what caused that conflict, which I believe I have encountered before but had no idea how to rectify, nor what caused it. Now, I feel like I have a better understanding of how it works, what causes it, and how to fix it. I also did not know how pull requests and merges happened between multiple parties, but I also figured that out as well.

###What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

The basic command line and git terminal commands were definitely solidified. Also, pushing to GitHub is getting easier. Sometimes I forget to complete all of the steps, but it is feeling more intuitive after doing it many times. I don't think I had any huge confusions before, but everything seems more solid now. My partner and I were able to solve most problems with minimal to no help or research.

####What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

Most of the questions asked were general clarification questions, like "is it time to do this?" or "we do this next, right?" I felt like we didn't require too much guidance in order to make things work. My pair and I communicated rather well.

###What still confuses you about git?

In terms of what I know about git right now, I don't have any questions. There may be things that involve git or GitHub that I have yet to encounter, and I'm sure when making pull requests in a real project with many team members will be a bit different than making them now, which feels relatively low-risk. I just think I need more practice with the commands and establishing muscle memory.

###How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

I was really nervous, which definitely affected my performance during the GPS. I messed up quite a few times, but I hope I was able to adequately display my knowledge of week one's materials. I think my pair and I were able to communicate well, but I don't think there was any situation where us pairing wasn't going to be a little awkward. I'm sure it gets easier and feels less forced the more practice we have, just like with using git, GitHub, or the Terminal itself.
