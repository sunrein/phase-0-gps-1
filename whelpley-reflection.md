**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
I came in with confusion over the pull request process in GitHub, and in jumping back to previous commits in git.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
I learned about how the GitHub pull request process works with two people, and why there are so many confirmation steps in the process.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
Aside from a general check-in with the pair, I asked questions about git syntax and the instructions to use. I asked the guide for instruction on navigating the pull request process.

**What still confuses you about git?**
I am still not clear on how to jump back to previous commits on a branch.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
Overall, I think it went well, in terms of working together with my pair and getting advice from the guide. There is still much awkwardness on my end in managing screens for the pair to see.
